Description: This package (or set of scripts) contains run scripts
	that build off of the forecasting package to post-process
	numerical weather prediction ensembles. This includes hand-holding
	functions to preprocess data to the right format, loop over a 
	series of forecasts to postprocess each in turn, and output 
	forecast quantiles of the postprocessed forecasts. 
Depends: R (>= 3.5.3),
	forecasting
